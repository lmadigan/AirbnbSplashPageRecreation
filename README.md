## Airbnb Splash Page Recreation (front-end demo project)


[AirBnb][Airbnb]  is an online marketplace that allows users to list properties available for rent, as well as search homes to stay at. Starting out as a networking site connecting renters with property owners, Airbnb has recently started to transition into an all inclusive experience site which, along with available listings, has experiences and featured locations. A selling point to Airbnb has been its incredible UI experience. Building off its easy to use interface with aesthetically pleasing design, I decided to recreate the Home Page with several features aimed at enhancing the user's experience by both capturing attention and creating a more dynamic, interactive user interface.

By recreating the home page, I will implement HTML/CSS tricks aimed at enhancing user's experience while encouraging user interaction. In the production README, I will have links to code snippets of the various features.

1) Hover effect that plays a slideshow of images associated with a given listing
2) Hover effect that rotates experience page 180 degrees to play video of event
2) Hover effect on featured destination

### Hover Over Listings to View Slideshow
